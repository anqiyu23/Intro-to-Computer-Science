# Intro-to-Computer-Science
Udacity online course taken in 2017 summer

## Build a Search Engine: 
Throughout this course, you’ll build a search engine by learning about and producing key search engine components including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm. As you build these pieces, you’ll be learning about and practicing computer science skills that will ready you for intermediate level computer science courses.

## Build a Social Network: 
At the end of the course we will give you a set of relationships (i.e. strings of phrases like “Dave likes Andy, Kathleen and Kristy”) and you will use your new computer science skills to organize these relationships into a social network. With your new social network, you can explore relationships and gain insight into how you fit into your own social networks.
